    \begin{itemize}
        \item inputs: Quantities that affect system over time
        \begin{itemize}
            \item endogenous inputs: Inputs that can be manipulated by designer
            \item exogenous inputs: Inputs that cannot be manipulated (environment e.g. Weather)
        \end{itemize}
        \item outputs: observations about the system
        \begin{itemize}
            \item measured outputs: Quantities that we can measure
            \item performance outputs: Quantities we cannot measure directly, but we want to control (e.g. average fuel consumption)
        \end{itemize}
        \item state: "memory" of the system
        \item parameters: specific quantities to system, do not change over time
\end{itemize}
