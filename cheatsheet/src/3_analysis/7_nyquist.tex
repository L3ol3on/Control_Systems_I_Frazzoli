\subsection{Nyquist Plot}
    reflect the polar plot about the horizontal axis ($\omega$ is extended to negative values)

    \subsubsection{Nyquist condition}
        $Z = N + P$, Z = closed loop unstable poles, N = number of clockwise encirclements of the point $-\frac{1}{k}$, P = number of open loop unstable poles
