\subsection{Dominant poles approximation}
    Poles with the least negative part decay the slowest and are therefore considered \textbf{dominant}\\
    $G(s) = \frac{130}{(s+5) (s+1) (s+0.5)} \approx \frac{26}{(s+1) (s+0.5)} = G_{\text{dom}}, G_{\text{dom}}(0) \overset{\!}{=} G(0)$\\
    Pole-Zero cancellation with $p \approx z$ can be executed using the same method
