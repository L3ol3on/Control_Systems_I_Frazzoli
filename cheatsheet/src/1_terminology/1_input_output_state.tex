\subsection{1.1 Input, Output, State}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{(Control) Input u(t)}: Quantities that affect system over time
        \begin{itemize}
            \item endogenous: manipulation by designer
            \item exogenous: generated by environment (e.g. Weather)
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Output / Measurement y(t)}: observations about the system
        \begin{itemize}
            \item measured outputs: Quantities that we can measure
            \item performance outputs: unmeasurable but controllable (e.g. average fuel consumption)
            \item $x(t_0)$ and all inputs $u(t_0)$ to $u(t)$ needed to predict $y(t)$
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{state x(t)}: "memory", summary of all past inputs
        \item disturbance d(t)
        \item parameter: specific quantities, do not change over time
\end{itemize}
